Check to see if asio and crow subfolders are empty (they probably are on the first pull)

If empty, run these two commands
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/crowcpp/crow.git
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio.git

They should now be populated with files

Next, run make and run the generated executable ./crow_service

Go to the following link in your web browser to ensure there is a message saying "Hello, Crow!"
    localhost:8080/
