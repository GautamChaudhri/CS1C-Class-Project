#2 As a user, I want to be able to reach out to the development team and recognize their identity by a logo/team name.

  a) Description:
       The application should display a "Contact Us" section that includes:
       - Team name
       - Team logo
       - Contact method
       
  b) Tasks:
       Design and create team logo
       Create a "Contact Us" component/section in the UI
       Add team name display
       Add team logo display
       Implement contact form or display contact information
       Style the contact section to match application theme
       
  c) Tests:
       Verify team logo displays correctly and is properly sized
       Verify team name is visible and properly formatted
       Verify contact information/method is accessible and functional
       Ensure contact section is responsive across different screen sizes
      
  d) Assignee: TBD
